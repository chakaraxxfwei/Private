# Privacy Policy
We will never collect any private data from you.  
In addition, the app will need to take photos and select photo permissions, mainly as a sign of habit.  
In addition, you need access to the microphone, which allows you to record and save the data. 
All the data will be saved locally, so you don't need to worry about data leakage.
